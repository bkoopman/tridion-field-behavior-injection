# Introduction #

A small GUI extension "framework" for extending the default SDL Tridion GUI extensions.

By following the GUI's own approach to allowing editable Experience Manager fields, we can create custom fields with a unique namespace as a future-friendly approach at adding schema field attributes.

Example use cases include:

  * Read-only fields
  * Show/hide functionality
  * Field-level validation
